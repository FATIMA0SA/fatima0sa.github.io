subtitle: Engineering with Intent — My Story in Data & AI
---

I’m a Data and Analytics professional with over 7 years of experience building scalable data systems using modern technology stacks. As a creative, detail-oriented thinker, I thrive on transforming complex data into actionable insights through programming, quantitative analysis, and workflow automation.

For me, data isn’t just numbers—it’s the key to solving real business problems with precision and impact. I’m passionate about designing solutions that are not only efficient but also meaningful, always seeking the brightest path through technical and strategic challenges.

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
