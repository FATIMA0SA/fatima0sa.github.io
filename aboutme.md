subtitle: Engineering with Intent ‚Äî My Story in Data & AI
---

I‚Äôm a Data and Analytics professional with over 7 years of experience building scalable data systems using modern technology stacks. As a creative, detail-oriented thinker, I thrive on transforming complex data into actionable insights through programming, quantitative analysis, and workflow automation.

For me, data isn‚Äôt just numbers‚Äîit‚Äôs the key to solving real business problems with precision and impact. I‚Äôm passionate about designing solutions that are not only efficient but also meaningful, always seeking the brightest path through technical and strategic challenges.

### My story

## üßë‚Äçüíº Who I Am

My journey in Data and Analytics began in 2018, sparked by a deep curiosity about how data can drive smarter decisions. I was fortunate to be awarded multiple sponsored fellowships from the **MiSK Foundation**, where I received hands-on training and exposure to modern data practices.

During that time, I completed several foundational programs:

- **Data Foundations**  
  Focused on understanding data types and classifications across domains.

- **Data Analyst (Python)**  
  Covered the entire data analysis lifecycle ‚Äî from business understanding and data acquisition to wrangling and delivering visual insights.

- **Business Analytics (Alteryx)**  
  A condensed course with a focus on time series forecasting and hands-on data workflows.

Even earlier, during my time in college, I pursued a selective course in what was then called *Data Mining* ‚Äî now widely recognized as *Data Science*. That early exposure laid the groundwork for a career driven by continuous learning and technical depth.
